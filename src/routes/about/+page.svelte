	<h1>Our Mission</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app designed for our CSE201 Project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Kazamama has developed this web app to try our hand at creating a small, local messaging
		service. None of us, aside from Kameron, have previously developed with SvelteKit - so this is
		and has been a very interesting experience while we learn new technologies.
	</p>

	<p>We hope you enjoy our efforts!</p>
